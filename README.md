### Project Description

Open-CyKG a framework that is constructed using an attention-based neural Open Information Extraction (OIE) model to extract valuable cyber threat information from unstructured Advanced
Persistent Threat (APT) reports. More specifically, we first identify relevant entities by developing a neural cybersecurity Named Entity Recognizer (NER) that aids in labeling relation triples generated by the OIE model. Afterwards, the extracted structured data is canonicalized to build the KG by employing fusion techniques using word embeddings.

*Overview of CESI. CESI first acquires side information of noun and relation phrases of Open KB triples. In the second step, it learns embeddings of these NPs and relation phrases while utilizing the side information obtained in previous step. In the third step, CESI performs clustering over the learned embeddings to canonicalize NP and relation phrases. Please refer paper for more details*




### Datasets

* OIE dataset: 
* NER dataset: 

For dataset files please refer to the refrence in the paper.

### Code:

#### Dependencies

* Compatible with both Python 3.x
* Dependencies can be installed as specified in Block 1 in the respective notebooks. 
* All the code was implemented on Google Colab using GPU. Please ensure that you are using the version as specified in the "√ènstallion and Drives" block.
* Make sure to adapt the code based on your dataset and choice of word embeddings.


#### Code Refrences:

* Functions in block 3&9 are originally refrenced from the work of Stanvosky et al. Please refer/cite his work, with exception of some modification in the functions Stanovsky, Gabriel, et al. `"Supervised open information extraction." Proceedings of the 2018 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long Papers). 2018.`
* OIE implements Bahdanau attention (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf). 

##### Start PPDB server:

* Running PPDB server is essential for running the main code.
* To start the server execute: `python ppdb/ppdb_server.py -port 9997`  (Let the server run in a separate terminal)

##### Run the main code:

* `python src/cesi_main.py -name reverb45_test_run`
* On executing the above command, all the output will be dumped in `output/reverb45_test_run` directory. 
* `-name` is an arbitrary name assigned to the run.
