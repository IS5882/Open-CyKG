### Project Description

Open-CyKG is a framework that is constructed using an attention-based neural Open Information Extraction (OIE) model to extract valuable cyber threat information from unstructured Advanced
Persistent Threat (APT) reports. More specifically, we first identify relevant entities by developing a neural cybersecurity Named Entity Recognizer (NER) that aids in labeling relation triples generated by the OIE model. Afterwards, the extracted structured data is canonicalized to build the KG by employing fusion techniques using word embeddings.

### Datasets

* OIE dataset: 
* NER dataset: 

For dataset files please refer to the refrence in the paper.

### Code:

#### Dependencies

* Compatible with both Python 3.x
* Dependencies can be installed as specified in Block 1 in the respective notebooks. 
* All the code was implemented on Google Colab using GPU. Please ensure that you are using the version as specified in the "Ïnstallion and Drives" block.
* Make sure to adapt the code based on your dataset and choice of word embeddings.
* To utlize CRF in NER model using Keras; plase make sure to:
	
	-- Use tensorFlow version and Keras version:
	
	-- In tensorflow_backend.py import those 2 liness ---> then restart runtime and run all
	
		```
		import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
		tf.disable_v2_behavior()
		```
		
	-- In Optimizer.py also import the aforementioned 2 lines and restart and run all {no use: tf.compat.v1.train.Optimizer}
